        <h3>The crackle of the bonfire feels deafening in the silence...</h3>
        <article class="narration">
            <p>You sink into the tall, blighted grass, your heart drumming against your ribs like a trapped bird. You move not as a warrior, but as a ghost. You let the darkness swallow you whole. Every inch of movement is a calculated risk; you wait for the wind to howl through the cavern's throat or for a goblin to laugh before you dare to shift your weight. The mud beneath your boots is cold and slick, smelling of old rot, but you ignore the chill.</p>
            <div id="second_paragraph">
                <p>Slowly—agonizingly slowly—you crawl past the ring of firelight. You are so close now that you can smell the scorched meat and the stench of unwashed fur. A goblin stands just three paces away, staring into the flames, oblivious to the 'Remnant' lurking in the periphery of its vision. The madness of the Spire whispers in your ear, tempting you to snap a dry twig just to see them jump... but you hold your breath until your lungs ache. You are the shadow that moves, the blade they will never see coming.</p>
